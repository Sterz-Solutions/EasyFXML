# EasyFXML - Usage samples

These samples aim to demonstrate usage of some specific modules or feature-sets.

Feel free to experiment with them!

- [EasyFXML (core)](../easyfxml)
  - [Simple Hello World greeter](easyfxml-sample-hello-world): Very basic usage of EasyFXML
  in the context of a single-view single-UI-component context. A good first look with as little
  overhead complexity than necessary to showcase what a minimal project would look like.
  
- [EasyFXML - FXKit](../easyfxml-fxkit)
  - [User identity form](easyfxml-sample-form-user): Basic form description, usage and testing for
  an imaginary user identity submission view

Finally, for a fully-fledged application example, have a look over at [Lyrebird](https://github.com/Tristan971/Lyrebird), 
a _JavaFX_ Twitter client. Note that it's not necessarily showing best usage or practices at the moment though.
